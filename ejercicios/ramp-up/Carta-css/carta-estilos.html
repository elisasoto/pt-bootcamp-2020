    <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
       <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
       <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as 
          part of your <ins>PhD</ins> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you 
      could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
      
      <ul>
        <li type="disc">First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li> 
      
      </ul>
      
      Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.
      You can find more information about <a href="https://www.university.com/">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
    
    </section>

      <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

      <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall 
      somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just 
      the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued 
      by are as follows, in order of priority:
      <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
      audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
      <li><ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS</ins> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
      
      So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the 
      research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

      <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

      <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, 
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        <dl>
          <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
          <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300<ins>BC</ins>. a whole village would dance around 
        in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</dd>
        
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which 
        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impercetably 
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired 
        modem styles such as Twerking.</dd>
        
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have 
        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants 
        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this 
        because they were really cold.</dd></p>
